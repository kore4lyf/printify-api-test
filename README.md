## Testing Tips

### Finding Valid Product IDs
1. Go to `/printify-api`
2. Click "Fetch Data" on "Shop Products"
3. Copy product ID from the results
4. Use in publish/unpublish tests

### Testing Orders
1. Fetch shop products to get valid IDs
2. Use "Create Order" form with:
   - Valid product ID
   - Variant ID from product
   - Shipping address with all required fields
   - Test cards: Use Printify test credit card numbers

### Testing Shipping
1. Go to `/shop/checkout`
2. Add products to cart
3. Enter different addresses
4. View calculated shipping costs

### Using the API Dashboard
- Start with "Fetch Data" on read operations
- Test single operations before bulk operations
- Use sample data provided in create forms
- Check "Catalog V2" for available endpoints

## Data Types

### Campaign
```typescript
interface Campaign {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  goal: number;
  raised: number;
  contributionOptions: ContributionOption[];
}
```

### ContributionOption

interface ContributionOption {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  amount: number;
  includesMerch: boolean;
}
```

  line_items: LineItem[];
  shipping_method: number;
  address_to: Address;
}
```

  model: string;
  images: string[];
}
```

## Technologies

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and development experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** - Pre-built accessible components
- **Printify SDK** - Official API integration
- **React Context** - State management for cart

## Common Tasks

### Add a New Campaign
Edit `src/lib/data.ts` and add to campaigns array.

### Test a New Product
1. Create product on Printify dashboard
2. Get blueprint ID
3. Use in "Create Product" form on API page

### Debug API Errors
1. Check environment variables
2. Verify Printify account access
3. Use `/printify-api` to test endpoints
4. Review error messages for API hints

### Test Order Flow
1. Fill cart with products
2. Enter valid shipping address
3. Complete checkout
4. Check Printify dashboard for order

## Troubleshooting

### 400 Bad Request Errors
- Use correct ID format (Printify IDs are numeric)
- Don't use MongoDB IDs from your database
- Verify product exists in your shop

### 422 Unprocessable Entity
- Product ID is invalid or doesn't exist
- Check Shop Products first to get valid IDs

### Shipping Calculation Fails
- Ensure all address fields are populated
- Phone number must be provided
- Region/state must be valid for country

### API Key Issues
- Verify `PRINTIFY_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- Check key hasn't expired on Printify dashboard
- Regenerate key if needed

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` with real API keys
- API keys are server-side only, never exposed to client
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Set up CORS properly for production
